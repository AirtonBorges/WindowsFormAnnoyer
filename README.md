# What is this?

This is just a little project of mine, it started when I got inspiration from Desktop Goose, 
that little goose that walks on you computer and annoys you.
So I tried to make a version for miself, but with Shrek.

Then, I had the idea to make a birthday gift for a friend, were the guy from Hollow Knight walks
Arround your computer and hits your cursor, so Im making this a little bit more modular

Eventualy Ill put a file here for instalation, but for now, I want just to commit the logic and
AI behind the movement and animation of this thing.
